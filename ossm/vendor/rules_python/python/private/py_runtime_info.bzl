:::{warning}
This is an **unstable public** API. It may change more frequently and has weaker
compatibility guarantees.
:::

A Python runtime describes either a *platform runtime* or an *in-build runtime*.
A platform runtime accesses a system-installed interpreter at a known path,
whereas an in-build runtime points to a `File` that acts as the interpreter. In
both cases, an "interpreter" is really any executable binary or wrapper script
that is capable of running a Python script passed on the command line, following
the same conventions as the standard CPython interpreter.

""",
        "bootstrap_template": """
:type: File

A template of code responsible for the initial startup of a program.

This code is responsible for:

* Locating the target interpreter. Typically it is in runfiles, but not always.
* Setting necessary environment variables, command line flags, or other
  configuration that can't be modified after the interpreter starts.
* Invoking the appropriate entry point. This is usually a second-stage bootstrap
  that performs additional setup prior to running a program's actual entry point.

The {obj}`--bootstrap_impl` flag affects how this stage 1 bootstrap
is expected to behave and the substutitions performed.

* `--bootstrap_impl=system_python` substitutions: `%is_zipfile%`, `%python_binary%`,
  `%target%`, `%workspace_name`, `%coverage_tool%`, `%import_all%`, `%imports%`,
  `%main%`, `%shebang%`
* `--bootstrap_impl=script` substititions: `%is_zipfile%`, `%python_binary%`,
  `%python_binary_actual%`, `%target%`, `%workspace_name`,
  `%shebang%`, `%stage2_bootstrap%`

Substitution definitions:

* `%shebang%`: The shebang to use with the bootstrap; the bootstrap template
  may choose to ignore this.
* `%stage2_bootstrap%`: A runfiles-relative path to the stage 2 bootstrap.
* `%python_binary%`: The path to the target Python interpreter. There are three
  types of paths:
  * An absolute path to a system interpreter (e.g. begins with `/`).
  * A runfiles-relative path to an interpreter (e.g. `somerepo/bin/python3`)
  * A program to search for on PATH, i.e. a word without spaces, e.g. `python3`.

  When `--bootstrap_impl=script` is used, this is always a runfiles-relative
  path to a venv-based interpreter executable.

* `%python_binary_actual%`: The path to the interpreter that
  `%python_binary%` invokes. There are three types of paths:
  * An absolute path to a system interpreter (e.g. begins with `/`).
  * A runfiles-relative path to an interpreter (e.g. `somerepo/bin/python3`)
  * A program to search for on PATH, i.e. a word without spaces, e.g. `python3`.

  Only set for zip builds with `--bootstrap_impl=script`; other builds will use
  an empty string.

* `%workspace_name%`: The name of the workspace the target belongs to.
* `%is_zipfile%`: The string `1` if this template is prepended to a zipfile to
  create a self-executable zip file. The string `0` otherwise.

For the other substitution definitions, see the {obj}`stage2_bootstrap_template`
docs.
