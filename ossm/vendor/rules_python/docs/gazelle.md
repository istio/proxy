# Gazelle plugin

[Gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle)
is a build file generator for Bazel projects. It can create new `BUILD.bazel` files for a project that follows language conventions and update existing build files to include new sources, dependencies, and options.

Bazel may run Gazelle using the Gazelle rule, or it may be installed and run as a command line tool.

See the documentation for Gazelle with rules_python in the {gh-path}`gazelle`
directory.
