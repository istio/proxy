    gazelle: ERROR: failed to validate dependencies for target "//:invalid_imported_module":

    "__init__.py", line 15: multiple targets (//foo:bar_1, //foo:bar_2) may be imported with "foo.bar": possible solutions:
    	1. Disambiguate the above multiple targets by removing duplicate srcs entries.
    	2. Use the '# gazelle:resolve py foo.bar TARGET_LABEL' BUILD file directive to resolve to one of the above targets.

    "__init__.py", line 15: "foo" is an invalid dependency: possible solutions:
    	1. Add it as a dependency in the requirements.txt file.
    	2. Use the '# gazelle:resolve py foo TARGET_LABEL' BUILD file directive to resolve to a known dependency.
    	3. Ignore it with a comment '# gazelle:ignore foo' in the Python file.

    gazelle: ERROR: failed to validate dependencies for target "//:invalid_imported_module":

    "__init__.py", line 18: "grpc" is an invalid dependency: possible solutions:
    	1. Add it as a dependency in the requirements.txt file.
    	2. Use the '# gazelle:resolve py grpc TARGET_LABEL' BUILD file directive to resolve to a known dependency.
    	3. Ignore it with a comment '# gazelle:ignore grpc' in the Python file.
