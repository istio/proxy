# Gazelle

This example demonstrates the buf's gazelle plugin.

## Build rules

The `proto_library`, `buf_lint_test` and `buf_breaking_test` rules are generated by `gazelle`

Delete all the rules and run,

```sh
bazel run //:gazelle
```

This will generate all the build rules.

## Repo rules

Delete `buf_deps.bzl` and run,

```sh
bazel run //:gazelle-update-repos
```

This will generate the repo rules in `buf_deps.bzl`.
