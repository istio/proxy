Test Data
=========

This package contains constants two sets of test data:
1) Proto definitions for various test cases. These define different types of messages and proto payloads which the test suite will attempt to compile.
2) The GoLang files contain consts which define the exact JSONSchemas which are expected to be generated by the tests.
