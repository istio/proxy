.SH NAME
io_uring_prep_link_timeout \- a timeout request for linked sqes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <liburing.h>
.PP
.BI "void io_uring_prep_link_timeout(struct io_uring_sqe *" sqe ","
.BI "                                struct __kernel_timespec *" ts ","
.BI "                                unsigned " flags ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR io_uring_prep_link_timeout (3)
function prepares a timeout request for linked sqes. The submission queue entry
.I sqe
is setup for with timeout specified by
.IR ts .
The flags argument holds modifier
.I flags
for the timeout behaviour of the request.

The
.I ts
argument must be filled in with the appropriate information for the timeout. It
looks as follows:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
struct __kernel_timespec {
    __kernel_time64_t tv_sec;
    long long tv_nsec;
};
.EE
.in
.PP

The
.I flags
argument may contain:
.TP
.B IORING_TIMEOUT_ABS
The value specified in
.I ts
is an absolute value rather than a relative one.
.TP
.B IORING_TIMEOUT_BOOTTIME
The boottime clock source should be used.
.TP
.B IORING_TIMEOUT_REALTIME
The realtime clock source should be used.
.TP
.B IORING_TIMEOUT_ETIME_SUCCESS
Consider an expired timeout a success in terms of the posted completion.
.PP

It is invalid to create a chain (linked sqes) consisting only of a link timeout
request. If all the requests in the chain are completed before timeout, then the
link timeout request gets canceled. Upon timeout, all the uncompleted requests
in the chain get canceled.

.SH RETURN VALUE
None

.SH ERRORS
.PP
These are the errors that are reported in the CQE
.I res
field. On success,
.B 0
is returned.
.TP
.B -ETIME
The specified timeout occurred and triggered the completion event.
.TP
.B -EINVAL
One of the fields set in the SQE was invalid. For example, two clock sources
where given, or the specified timeout seconds or nanoseconds where < 0.
.TP
.B -EFAULT
io_uring was unable to access the data specified by ts.
.TP
.B -ECANCELED
The timeout was canceled because all submitted requests were completed successfully
or one of the requests resulted in failure.
.TP
.B -ENOENT
The request to which the linked timeout was linked already completed and could
not be found when the timer expired.
