"""Core bundling logic.

The processor module handles the execution of logic for different parts of the
bundling process. This logic is encapsulated into blocks of code called
partials. Each partial will then process a specific aspect of the build process
and will return information on how the bundles should be built.

All partials handled by this processor must follow this API:

  - The expected output is a struct with the following optional fields:
    * bundle_files: Contains tuples of the format
      (location_type, parent_dir, files) where location_type is a field of the
      location enum. The files are then placed at the given location in the
      output bundle.
    * bundle_zips: Contains tuples of the format
      (location_type, parent_dir, files) where location_type is a field of the
      location enum and each file is a ZIP file. The files extracted from the
      ZIPs are then placed at the given location in the output bundle.
    * output_files: Depset of `File`s that should be returned as outputs of the
      target.
    * output_groups: Dictionary of output group names to depset of Files that should be returned in
      the OutputGroupInfo provider.
    * providers: Providers that will be collected and returned by the rule.
    * signed_frameworks: Depset of frameworks which were already signed during the bundling phase.

Location types can be:
  - archive: Files are to be placed relative to the archive of the bundle
    (i.e. the root of the zip/IPA file to generate).
  - app_clip: Files are to be placed in the AppClips section of the bundle.
  - binary: Files are to be placed in the binary section of the bundle.
  - bundle: Files are to be placed at the root of the bundle.
  - content: Files are to be placed in the contents section of the bundle.
  - extension: Files are to be placed in the Extensions section of the bundle.
  - framework: Files are to be placed in the Frameworks section of the bundle.
  - plugin: Files are to be placed in the PlugIns section of the bundle.
  - resources: Files are to be placed in the resources section of the bundle.
  - watch: Files are to be placed inside the Watch section of the bundle. Only applicable for iOS
    apps.

For iOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS, binary, content and resources all refer to the same
location. Only in macOS these paths differ.

All the files given will be symlinked into their expected location in the
bundle, and once complete, the processor will codesign and compress the bundle
into a zip file.

The processor will output a single file, which is the final compressed and
code-signed bundle, and a list of providers that need to be propagated from the
rule.

      bundle_name: The name of the output bundle.
      bundle_post_process_and_sign: If the process action should also post process and sign after
          calling the implementation of every partial. Defaults to True.
      codesign_inputs: Extra inputs needed for the `codesign` tool.
      codesignopts: Extra options to pass to the `codesign` tool.
      entitlements: The entitlements file to sign with. Can be `None` if one was not provided.
      features: List of features enabled by the user. Typically from `ctx.features`.
      ipa_post_processor: A file that acts as a bundle post processing tool. Defaults to `None`.
      locales_to_include: List of locales to explicitly include in the bundle. Defaults tp `[]`.

      partials: The list of partials to process to construct the complete bundle.
      platform_prerequisites: Struct containing information on the platform being targeted.
      predeclared_outputs: Outputs declared by the owning context. Typically from `ctx.outputs`.
      process_and_sign_template: A template for a shell script to process and sign as a file.
      provisioning_profile: File for the provisioning profile.
      rule_descriptor: A rule descriptor for platform and product types from the rule context.
      rule_label: The label of the target being analyzed.

    Returns:
      A `struct` with the results of the processing. The files to make outputs of
      the rule are contained under the `output_files` field, the providers to
      return are contained under the `providers` field, and a dictionary containing
