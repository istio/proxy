    This partial propagates the AppleDynamicFrameworkInfo provider required by

    the framework can be linked against. This is only required for dynamic
    framework bundles.

    Args:
      actions: The actions provider from `ctx.actions`.
      bin_root_path: The path to the root `-bin` directory.
      binary_artifact: The linked dynamic framework binary.
      bundle_name: The name of the output bundle.
      bundle_only: Only include the bundle but do not link the framework
      cc_features: List of enabled C++ features.
      cc_info: The CcInfo provider containing information about the
          targets linked into the dynamic framework.
      cc_toolchain: The C++ toolchain to use.
      rule_label: The label of the target being analyzed.

    Returns:
      A partial that returns the AppleDynamicFrameworkInfo provider used to link
      this framework into the final binary.
