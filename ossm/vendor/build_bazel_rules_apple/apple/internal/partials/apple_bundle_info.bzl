    This partial propagates the AppleBundleInfo provider for this target.

    Args:
      actions: The actions provider from ctx.actions.
      bundle_id: The bundle ID to configure for this target.
      bundle_extension: Extension for the Apple bundle inside the archive.
      bundle_name: The name of the output bundle.
      entitlements: The entitlements file to sign with. Can be `None` if one was not provided.
      executable_name: The name of the output executable.
      extension_safe: True if the target propagating this provider was compiled
        and linked with -application-extension, restricting it to extension-safe
        APIs only.
      label_name: Name of the target being built.
      output_discriminator: A string to differentiate between different target intermediate files
          or `None`.
      platform_prerequisites: Struct containing information on the platform being targeted.
      predeclared_outputs: Outputs declared by the owning context. Typically from `ctx.outputs`.
      product_type: Product type identifier used to describe the current bundle type.
      rule_descriptor: The rule descriptor for the given rule.

    Returns:
      A partial that returns the AppleBundleInfo provider.
