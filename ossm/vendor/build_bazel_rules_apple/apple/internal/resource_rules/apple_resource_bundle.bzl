Please see [Info.plist Handling](/doc/common_info.md#infoplist-handling") for what is supported.

Duplicate keys between infoplist files
will cause an error if and only if the values conflict.
Bazel will perform variable substitution on the Info.plist file for the following values (if they
are strings in the top-level dict of the plist):

${BUNDLE_NAME}: This target's name and bundle suffix (.bundle or .app) in the form name.suffix.
${PRODUCT_NAME}: This target's name.
${TARGET_NAME}: This target's name.
The key in ${} may be suffixed with :rfc1034identifier (for example
${PRODUCT_NAME::rfc1034identifier}) in which case Bazel will replicate Xcode's behavior and replace
non-RFC1034-compliant characters with -.

files are placed in the root of the resource bundle (e.g. `Payload/foo.app/bar.bundle/...`) in most
cases. However, if they appear to be localized (i.e. are contained in a directory called *.lproj),
they will be placed in a directory of the same name in the app bundle.
