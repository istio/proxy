</pre>

This rule encapsulates an already-built dynamic framework. It is defined by a list of
files in exactly one `.framework` directory. `apple_dynamic_framework_import` targets
need to be added to library targets through the `deps` attribute.
### Examples

```python
apple_dynamic_framework_import(
    name = "my_dynamic_framework",
    framework_imports = glob(["my_dynamic_framework.framework/**"]),
)

objc_library(
    name = "foo_lib",
    ...,
    deps = [
        ":my_dynamic_framework",
    ],
)
```

This rule encapsulates an already-built static framework. It is defined by a list of
files in exactly one `.framework` directory. `apple_static_framework_import` targets
need to be added to library targets through the `deps` attribute.
### Examples

| <a id="apple_static_framework_import-alwayslink"></a>alwayslink |  If true, any binary that depends (directly or indirectly) on this framework will link in all the object files for the framework file, even if some contain no symbols referenced by the binary. This is useful if your code isn't explicitly called by code in the binary; for example, if you rely on runtime checks for protocol conformances added in extensions in the library but do not directly reference any other symbols in the object file that adds that conformance.   | Boolean | optional |  `False`  |

For macOS, only `Foundation` is always included. When linking a top level binary, all SDK frameworks listed in that binary's transitive dependency graph are linked.   | List of strings | optional |  `[]`  |

</pre>

This rule produces single- or multi-architecture ("fat") static libraries targeting
Apple platforms.

The `lipo` tool is used to combine files of multiple architectures. One of
several flags may control which architectures are included in the output,
depending on the value of the `platform_type` attribute.

NOTE: In most situations, users should prefer the platform- and
product-type-specific rules, such as `apple_static_xcframework`. This
rule is being provided for the purpose of transitioning users from the built-in
implementation of `apple_static_library` in Bazel core so that it can be removed.

**ATTRIBUTES**


| Name  | Description | Type | Mandatory | Default |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |

| <a id="apple_static_library-platform_type"></a>platform_type |  The target Apple platform for which to create a binary. This dictates which SDK is used for compilation/linking and which flag is used to determine the architectures to target. For example, if `ios` is specified, then the output binaries/libraries will be created combining all architectures specified by `--ios_multi_cpus`. Options are:<br><br>*   `ios`: architectures gathered from `--ios_multi_cpus`. *   `macos`: architectures gathered from `--macos_cpus`. *   `tvos`: architectures gathered from `--tvos_cpus`. *   `visionos`: architectures gathered from `--visionos_cpus`. *   `watchos`: architectures gathered from `--watchos_cpus`.   | String | required |  |

| <a id="apple_static_library-weak_sdk_frameworks"></a>weak_sdk_frameworks |  Names of SDK frameworks to weakly link with (e.g., `MediaAccessibility`). Unlike regularly linked SDK frameworks, symbols from weakly linked frameworks do not cause the binary to fail to load if they are not present in the version of the framework available at runtime.<br><br>This attribute is discouraged; in general, targets should list system framework dependencies in the library targets where that framework is used, not in the top-level bundle.   | List of strings | optional |  `[]`  |

| <a id="apple_static_xcframework-bundle_name"></a>bundle_name |  The desired name of the XCFramework bundle (without the extension) and the binaries for all embedded static libraries. If this attribute is not set, then the name of the target will be used instead.   | String | optional |  `""`  |

If this attribute is not set, then the name of the `bundle_name` attribute will be used if it is set; if not, then the name of the target will be used instead.   | String | optional |  `""`  |
| <a id="apple_static_xcframework-families_required"></a>families_required |  A list of device families supported by this extension, with platforms such as `ios` as keys.

| <a id="apple_static_xcframework-umbrella_header"></a>umbrella_header |  An optional single .h file to use as the umbrella header for this framework. Usually, this header will have the same name as this target, so that clients can load the header using the #import <MyFramework/MyFramework.h> format.

</pre>

This rule declares a bazel target that you can pass to the
`provisioning_profile` attribute of rules that support it. It discovers a
provisioning profile for the given attributes either on the user's local
machine, or with the optional `fallback_profiles` passed to
`provisioning_profile_repository`.

This rule will automatically pick the newest
profile if there are multiple profiles matching the given criteria.

By default this rule will search for a `.mobileprovision` file with the same name
as the rule itself, you can pass `profile_name` to use a different name, you
can pass `team_id` if you'd like to disambiguate between 2 Apple developer accounts
that have the same profile name. You may also pass `.provisionprofile` to
`profile_extension` to search for a macOS provisioning profile instead.

## Example

```starlark
load("//apple:apple.bzl", "local_provisioning_profile")

local_provisioning_profile(
    name = "app_debug_profile",
    profile_name = "Development App",
    team_id = "abc123",
)

ios_application(
    name = "app",
    ...
    provisioning_profile = ":app_debug_profile",
)

local_provisioning_profile(
    name = "app_release_profile",
)

ios_application(
    name = "release_app",
    ...
    provisioning_profile = ":app_release_profile",
)
```

Compiles and links Objective-C and Swift code into a static library.

This is an experimental macro that supports compiling mixed Objective-C and
Swift source files into a static library.

Due to build performance reasons, in general it's not recommended to
have mixed Objective-C and Swift modules, but it isn't uncommon to see
mixed language modules in some codebases. This macro is meant to make
it easier to migrate codebases with mixed language modules to Bazel without
having to demix them first.

## provisioning_profile_repository

provisioning_profile_repository(<a href="#provisioning_profile_repository-name">name</a>, <a href="#provisioning_profile_repository-fallback_profiles">fallback_profiles</a>, <a href="#provisioning_profile_repository-repo_mapping">repo_mapping</a>)
</pre>

This rule declares an external repository for discovering locally installed
provisioning profiles. This is consumed by `local_provisioning_profile`.
You can optionally set 'fallback_profiles' to point at a stable location of
profiles if a newer version of the desired profile does not exist on the local
machine. This is useful for checking in the current version of the profile, but
not having to update it every time a new device or certificate is added.

## Example

### In your `MODULE.bazel` file:

You only need this in the case you want to setup fallback profiles, otherwise
it can be ommitted when using bzlmod.

```bzl
provisioning_profile_repository = use_extension("@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple:apple.bzl", "provisioning_profile_repository_extension")
provisioning_profile_repository.setup(
    fallback_profiles = "//path/to/some:filegroup", # Profiles to use if one isn't found locally
)
```

### In your `WORKSPACE` file:

```starlark
load("//apple:apple.bzl", "provisioning_profile_repository")

provisioning_profile_repository(
    name = "local_provisioning_profiles",
    fallback_profiles = "//path/to/some:filegroup", # Optional profiles to use if one isn't found locally
)
```

### In your `BUILD` files (see `local_provisioning_profile` for more examples):

```starlark
load("//apple:apple.bzl", "local_provisioning_profile")

local_provisioning_profile(
    name = "app_debug_profile",
    profile_name = "Development App",
    team_id = "abc123",
)

ios_application(
    name = "app",
    ...
    provisioning_profile = ":app_debug_profile",
)
```

This allows controls over workspace dependency resolution for dependencies of this repository.<br><br>For example, an entry `"@foo": "@bar"` declares that, for any time this repository depends on `@foo` (such as a dependency on `@foo//some:target`, it should actually resolve that dependency within globally-declared `@bar` (`@bar//some:target`).<br><br>This attribute is _not_ supported in `MODULE.bazel` context (when invoking a repository rule inside a module extension's implementation function).   | <a href="https://bazel.build/rules/lib/dict">Dictionary: String -> String</a> | optional |  |
