    """Creates test targets for an Apple shell integration test script.

    This macro allows for the easy creation of multiple test targets that each
    run the given test script, but with different configuration arguments passed
    into the test's `bazel` invocations. For example:

        apple_multi_shell_test(
            name = "my_test",
            src = "my_test.sh",
            configurations = {

                "device": ["--ios_multi_cpus=arm64,armv7"],
            },
        )

    The above snippet would create three targets, named based on the
    configurations:

    * my_test.simulator: applies "--ios_multi_cpus=x86_64" to all builds.
    * my_test.device: applies "--ios_multi_cpus=arm64,armv7" to all builds.
    * my_test: A test suite containing the above tests.

      name: The name of the test suite and prefix to use for each of the
          individual configuration tests.
      src: The shell script to run.
      configurations: A dictionary with the configurations for which the test
          should be run.
      **kwargs: Additional attribute values to apply to each test target.
