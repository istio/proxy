# This script allows many of the functions in apple_shell_testutils.sh to be
# called through apple_verification_test_runner.sh.template by using environment
# variables.
#
# Supported operations:
#
#  Archive contents tests:
#
#  - CONTAINS: takes a list of files to test for existance. The filename will be
#      expanded with bash and can contain variables (e.g. $BUNDLE_ROOT)
#  - NOT_CONTAINS: takes a list of files to test for non-existance. The filename
#      will be expanded with bash and can contain variables (e.g. $BUNDLE_ROOT)
#
#  Binary plist tests:
#
#  - IS_BINARY_PLIST: takes a list of paths to plist files and checks that they
#      are `binary` format. Filenames are expanded with bash.
#  - IS_NOT_BINARY_PLIST: takes a list of paths to plist files and checks that
#      they are not `binary` format. Filenames are expanded with bash.
#
#  Property list (.plist) file tests:
#
#  PLIST_TEST_FILE: The plist file to test with `PLIST_TEST_VALUES`.
#  PLIST_TEST_VALUES: Array for keys and values in the format "KEY VALUE" where
#      the key is in PlistBuddy format(which can't contain spaces), followed by
#      by a single space, followed by the value to test. * can be used as a
#      wildcard value.
#
#  Asset catalog file tests:
#
#  - ASSET_CATALOG_FILE: The Asset.car file to test against.
#  - ASSET_CATALOG_CONTAINS: Array of asset names that should exist.
#  - ASSET_CATALOG_NOT_CONTAINS: Array of asset names that should not exist.
#
#  Text file tests:
#
#  Regular expressions for these tests must follow POSIX Basic Regular
#  Expression (BRE) syntax.
#
#  - TEXT_TEST_FILE: The text file to test with `TEXT_TEST_VALUES` or
#      `TEXT_FILE_NOT_CONTAINS`.
#  - TEXT_TEST_VALUES: Array for regular expressions expected to match against
#      the contents of the text file.
#  - TEXT_FILE_NOT_CONTAINS: Array for regular expressions not expected to match
#      against the contents of the text file.
#
#  Linked binary file tests:
#
#  - BINARY_NOT_CONTAINS_ARCHITECTURES: The architectures to verify are not in
#      the assembled binary.
#  - BINARY_TEST_FILE: The binary file to test against.
#  - BINARY_TEST_ARCHITECTURE: Architecture to use with `BINARY_TEST_SYMBOLS`.
#  - BINARY_CONTAINS_SYMBOLS: Array of symbols that should be present.
#  - BINARY_NOT_CONTAINS_SYMBOLS: Array of symbols that should not be present.
#  - CODESIGN_INFO_CONTAINS: Array of codesign information that should
#      be present.
#  - CODESIGN_INFO_NOT_CONTAINS: Array of codesign information that should
#      not be present.
#
#  Mach-O file tests:
#
#  - MACHO_LOAD_COMMANDS_CONTAIN: Array of Mach-O load commands that should
#      be present.
#  - MACHO_LOAD_COMMANDS_NOT_CONTAIN: Array of Mach-O load commands that should
#      not be present.
#
#  Archive file permissions tests:
#  - ASSERT_FILE_PERMISSIONS: Array of "KEY VALUE" formatted strings where key
#      specifies a bundle file path, and value is the expected numerical file
#      permissions bits. See apple_shell_testutils' assert_permissions_equal
#      for supported formats.
