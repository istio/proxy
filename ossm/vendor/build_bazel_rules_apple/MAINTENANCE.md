This document outlines the processes we follow to maintain the 3 Apple
rules repos (this doc is not duplicated across the repos):

- [`apple_support`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/apple_support)
- [`rules_apple`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple)
- [`rules_swift`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift)

# Maintainers

The current maintainers can be seen in the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS)
file.

## How to become a maintainer

These rules are community maintained. Any community member can become a
maintainer. Ideally we have a large set of maintainers who can work on
improving different parts of the rules for different use cases. In order
to become a maintainer you must demonstrate proficiency working on these
bazel rules. The best way to do this is to contribute multiple
non-trivial features over time. If you would like to become a
maintainer, once you have a collection of non-trivial changes, reach out
to Keith Smiley (keithbsmiley@gmail.com) with links to your changes.
Once you have met these criteria the existing maintainers will vote and
require a 2/3rds majority to add new maintainers. Otherwise the
maintainers will provide specific feedback on what they would like to
see before granting access.

# Upstream changes

While these rulesets are now maintained outside of Google, Google still
pushes their internal changes to the `upstream` branch on each repo.
This branch is not intended to be relied on directly, and does not
accept contribution, but can be cherry-picked from by the maintainer's
discretion. In general we try to take all upstream changes so that we
diverge less.

## Cherry-pick process

When a new commit is pushed to the `upstream` branch there are a few
things to do.

- Cherry-pick the commit onto the `master` branch with `git cherry-pick -x
  SHA`. Including `-x` makes it easier to trace back to the upstream
  commit.
- Submit a PR with this change.
- Comment on the upstream commit with the link to the PR so it can be.
  traced back in the future.
- Push more commits to the PR if compatibility changes are necessary.
  It's up to your discretion to resolve conflicts in subsequent commits
  or during the cherry pick. Sometimes the former may be preferred if
  there are significant conflicts so that it's easier to review.
- Get a review from a maintainer.
- Merge using the "Rebase and Merge" strategy. This way original
  authorship is maintained.

### Tips

- You can see the upstream commits
  [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/compare/upstream) and
  know which ones have been cherry picked or not based on whether or not
  they have a comment. This is why it's important to comment on the
  commit after you cherry-pick it.
- You can find RSS feeds for the commits
  [here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/commits/upstream.atom).
- If for some reason a cherry-pick PR cannot be merged because of
  external vs Google compatibility, create a PR or issue that indicates
  when it can be merged in the future.
- If for some reason a commit should never be cherry picked, comment on
  it to indicate why and so it appears triaged for the future.

# Reviews

In general normal PRs and cherry-pick PRs should receive reviews from
other maintainers before merging.

## Trivial changes

As a maintainer you can use your best judgement if you believe a fix is
trivial enough that it does not need review. This also applies for
merging external contributors changes.

## Significant changes

In general significant changes and new rules should be generally agreed
upon by multiple maintainers. This way we can keep the rules generally
applicable, and maintainable for the long term.

# Releases

Releases should be cut on a relatively regular schedule, often to align
with bazel releases since they often require rules changes for
compatibility, but they can also be cut more frequently as desired. Here
is the recommended process:

- Check that all repos are up to date with cherry picks, and that all
  open cherry-pick PRs have been merged.
- Lightly triage open PRs and issues to make sure that anything that
  should be merged or fixed before the new release has been.
- Compare the current HEAD of the repo with the last release using a
  command such as `git log 0.21.1...HEAD` or [on
  GitHub](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/compare/0.21.1...HEAD),
  and collect the most notable user facing commits for the release
  notes.
- Starting with `apple_support` run the `Create Release` GitHub action
  where the only input is the release's version number. This
  automatically creates the release on GitHub.
- Edit the release to fill in the release notes and supported bazel
  versions.
- Update the `swift/repositories.bzl` & `MODULE.bazel` files in `rules_swift` with the new
  `apple_support` release.
- Repeat the steps above to create a release on `rules_swift`.
- Update the `apple/repositories.bzl` and `MODULE.bazel` files in `rules_apple` with the new
  `apple_support` and `rules_swift` releases.
- Repeat the steps above to create a release on `rules_apple`.
- Update the `url` and `sha256` values in the [ios-app tutorial](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/master/doc/tutorials/ios-app.md#update-the-workspace-file) to match the latest release.

### Notes

- It's highly recommended that rules maintainers track more closely with
  the HEAD of the rules repos than with the releases.
- In general before releasing the HEAD of the rules repos should be
  tested on non-trivial projects, ideally that is mostly covered by the
  point above.
- Not all rules repos will have changes every time you go to create a
  new release, in those cases you can skip those repos and the version
  bumps associated with them.
- Rules repos can be released on a separate cadence if needed, but given
  the current frequency it's best to intentionally do them all at once.
- If we go a long time without a new release of the rules, but while
  still updating bazel versions, you can update the most recent release
  to show that it has been tested with the newer version, rather than
  the repo being entirely inactive.
