imported_dynamic_framework_processor processes an imported dynamic framework
such that the given framework only contains the same slices as the app binary,
copies every file belonging to the dynamic framework to a temporary location,
then codesigns and zips the dynamic framework as a cacheable artifact.

imported_dynamic_framework_processor can run on Darwin only.
