"""Filtered rule kinds for aspect inspection.

The format of this dictionary is:
  rule_name: [attr, attr, ...]

Filters for rules that are not part of the Bazel distribution should be added
to this file.

Attributes are either the explicit list of attributes to filter, or '_*' which
would ignore all attributes prefixed with a _.
