Jira ticket: [PROJ-IDENT]

<!--
# Opening vs Drafting a PR:
When opening a pull request, please open it as a draft to not auto assign reviewers before you feel the pull request is in a reviewable state.

# Linking a JIRA ticket:
Please link your JIRA ticket by adding its identifier between brackets (ex [PROJ-IDENT]) in the PR description, not the title.
This requirement only applies to Datadog employees.
