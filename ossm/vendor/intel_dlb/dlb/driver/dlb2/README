The Linux DLB2 driver is a kernel module that supports configuration and use of
the DLB2 device.

The driver uses the kbuild
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt) build system. To
build out-of-tree, simply run 'make'. You can optionally specify the KSRC
environment variable to specify the kernel source tree to build against. (If
unspecified, the build uses the host OS's kernel headers.)

To build in-tree, run './scripts/patch_kernel_tree.sh <Path to Linux kernel
source>' to patch the kernel source tree and then build the kernel as usual.
