ERROR: target {target} is not configured to produce any outputs.

Bazel only executes actions when their outputs are required, so it's never correct to create an action with no outputs.

Possible fixes:
- Predict what outputs are created, and list them in the outs and out_dirs attributes.
- If {rule_kind} is a binary, and you meant to run it for its side-effects,
  then call it directly with `bazel run` and don't wrap it in a run_binary rule.

    """Runs a binary as a build action.

    This rule does not require Bash (unlike `native.genrule`).

    Args:
        name: The target name

        tool: The tool to run in the action.

            Must be the label of a *_binary rule of a rule that generates an executable file, or of
            a file that can be executed as a subprocess (e.g. an .exe or .bat file on Windows or a
            binary with executable permission on Linux). This label is available for `$(location)`
            expansion in `args` and `env`.
        srcs: Additional inputs of the action.

            These labels are available for `$(location)` expansion in `args` and `env`.

        args: Command line arguments of the binary.

            Subject to `$(location)` and make variable expansions via
            [expand_location](./expand_make_vars#expand_locations)
            and [expand_make_vars](./expand_make_vars).

        env: Environment variables of the action.

            Subject to `$(location)` and make variable expansions via
            [expand_location](./expand_make_vars#expand_locations)
            and [expand_make_vars](./expand_make_vars).

        outs: Output files generated by the action.

            These labels are available for `$(location)` expansion in `args` and `env`.

            Output files cannot be nested within output directories in out_dirs.

        out_dirs: Output directories generated by the action.

            These labels are _not_ available for `$(location)` expansion in `args` and `env` since
            they are not pre-declared labels created via `attr.output_list()`. Output directories are
            declared instead by `ctx.actions.declare_directory`.

            Output directories cannot be nested within other output directories in out_dirs.

        mnemonic: A one-word description of the action, for example, CppCompile or GoLink.

        progress_message: Progress message to show to the user during the build, for example,
            "Compiling foo.cc to create foo.o". The message may contain %{label}, %{input}, or
            %{output} patterns, which are substituted with label string, first input, or output's
            path, respectively. Prefer to use patterns instead of static strings, because the former
            are more efficient.

        execution_requirements: Information for scheduling the action.

            For example,

            ```
            execution_requirements = {
                "no-cache": "1",
            },
            ```

            See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/be/common-definitions.html#common.tags for useful keys.

        use_default_shell_env: Passed to the underlying ctx.actions.run.

            May introduce non-determinism when True; use with care!
            See e.g. https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4912

            Refer to https://bazel.build/rules/lib/builtins/actions#run for more details.

        stamp: Whether to include build status files as inputs to the tool. Possible values:

            - `stamp = 0` (default): Never include build status files as inputs to the tool.
                This gives good build result caching.
                Most tools don't use the status files, so including them in `--stamp` builds makes those
                builds have many needless cache misses.
                (Note: this default is different from most rules with an integer-typed `stamp` attribute.)
            - `stamp = 1`: Always include build status files as inputs to the tool, even in
                [--nostamp](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/user-manual.html#flag--stamp) builds.
                This setting should be avoided, since it is non-deterministic.
                It potentially causes remote cache misses for the target and
                any downstream actions that depend on the result.
            - `stamp = -1`: Inclusion of build status files as inputs is controlled by the
                [--[no]stamp](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/user-manual.html#flag--stamp) flag.
                Stamped targets are not rebuilt unless their dependencies change.

            When stamping is enabled, an additional two environment variables will be set for the action:
                - `BAZEL_STABLE_STATUS_FILE`
                - `BAZEL_VOLATILE_STATUS_FILE`

            These files can be read and parsed by the action, for example to pass some values to a linker.
