# Speed up all builds by not checking if output files have been modified. Lets you make changes to
# the output tree without triggering a build for local debugging. For example, you can modify
# [rules_js](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js) 3rd party npm packages in the output tree
# when local debugging.

# Don't apply `--noremote_upload_local_results` and `--noremote_accept_cached` to the disk cache.
# If you have both `--noremote_upload_local_results` and `--disk_cache`, then this fixes a bug where
# Bazel doesn't write to the local disk cache as it treats as a remote cache.

# NB: This flag is in bazel6.bazelrc because it became a no-op in Bazel 7 and has been removed

# Propagate tags from a target declaration to the actions' execution requirements.
# Ensures that tags applied in your BUILD file, like `tags=["no-remote"]`
# get propagated to actions created by the rule.
# Without this option, you rely on rules authors to manually check the tags you passed
# and apply relevant ones to the actions they create.

# Do not build runfiles symlink forests for external repositories under
# `.runfiles/wsname/external/repo` (in addition to `.runfiles/repo`). This reduces runfiles &
# sandbox creation times & prevents accidentally depending on this feature which may flip to off by

# author.
