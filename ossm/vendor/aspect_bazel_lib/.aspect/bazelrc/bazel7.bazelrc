# Don't report when the root module's lower bound for a dependency happens to be less than the resolved version.
# This is expected and should NOT prompt an engineer to update our lower bound to match.
# WARNING: For repository 'aspect_bazel_lib', the root module requires module version aspect_bazel_lib@1.30.2,
# but got aspect_bazel_lib@1.31.2 in the resolved dependency graph.

# Directories used by sandboxed non-worker execution may be reused to avoid unnecessary setup costs.
# Save time on Sandbox creation and deletion when many of the same kind of action run during the
# build.

# Do not build runfiles symlink forests for external repositories under
# `.runfiles/wsname/external/repo` (in addition to `.runfiles/repo`). This reduces runfiles &
# sandbox creation times & prevents accidentally depending on this feature which may flip to off by
# default in the future. Note, some rules may fail under this flag, please file issues with the rule
# author.
