# Save time on Sandbox creation and deletion when many of the same kind of action run during the

# This may break local workflows that `build` a binary target, then run the resulting program
# outside of `bazel run`. In those cases, the script will need to call
# `bazel build --build_runfile_links //my/binary:target` and then execute the resulting program.
