# Proto Converter

Proto Converter is a library that supports the conversion between protobuf binary and json. It is only for proxies to convert between protobuf and json in stream. Normal users follow [Protobuf Buffers Developer Guide](https://protobuf.dev/) and use the [json_util](https://protobuf.dev/reference/cpp/api-docs/google.protobuf.util.json_util) to do conversion instead.
