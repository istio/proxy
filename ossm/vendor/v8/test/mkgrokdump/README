If you change the heap layout, expect this test to fail (in CQ). You will then
need to build x64 release with v8_enable_sandbox=true and run
`<outdir>/mkgrokdump > tools/v8heapconst.py` to rebaseline.
The V8 sandbox has to be manually enabled as it is enabled by default only for
Chromium builds, but not standalone v8 builds.
