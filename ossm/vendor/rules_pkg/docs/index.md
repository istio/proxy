# bazelbuild/rules_pkg

    Cookbook examples for using the rules.

## Reference

We are in the process of migrating from hand-written docs to generated ones.
Some rules are fully documented in their definitions, and will have complete
documentation in the Latest or versioned snapshots. Some rules still have
attributes only defined in the "Legacy" documentation. You may have to
consult more than one place to get a complete picture.
