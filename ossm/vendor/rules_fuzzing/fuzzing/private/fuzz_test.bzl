    This macro can be used to define custom fuzz test rules in case the default
    `cc_fuzz_test` macro is not adequate. Refer to the `cc_fuzz_test` macro
    documentation for the set of targets generated.

    Args:
        name: The name prefix of the generated targets. It is normally the
          fuzz test name in the BUILD file.
        raw_binary: The label of the cc_binary or cc_test of fuzz test
          executable.
        engine: The label of the fuzzing engine used to build the binary.
        corpus: A list of corpus files.
        dicts: A list of fuzzing dictionary files.
        instrument_binary: **(Experimental, may be removed in the future.)**

          By default, the generated targets depend on `raw_binary` through
          a Bazel configuration using flags from the `@rules_fuzzing//fuzzing`
          package to determine the fuzzing build mode, engine, and sanitizer
          instrumentation.

          When this argument is false, the targets assume that `raw_binary` is
          already built in the proper configuration and will not apply the
          transition.

          Most users should not need to change this argument. If you think the
          default instrumentation mode does not work for your use case, please
          file a Github issue to discuss.
        define_regression_test: If true, generate a regression test rule.
        test_size: The size of the fuzzing regression test.
        test_tags: Tags set on the fuzzing regression test.
        test_timeout: The timeout for the fuzzing regression test.

      for debugging or for accessing the complete command line interface of the

      simpler, engine-agnostic command line interface.

      the fuzz target executable and its associated resources (corpus,
