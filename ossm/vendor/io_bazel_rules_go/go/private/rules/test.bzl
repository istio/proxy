    variables in the test environment by passing
    `--test_env=VAR=value <test_env_>`. You can terminate test execution after the first

    the testbinary can be invoked with `-test.v` by setting
    `GO_TEST_WRAP_TESTV=1` in the test environment; this will result in the

    ***Note:*** To interoperate cleanly with old targets generated by [Gazelle], `name`
    should be `go_default_test` for internal tests and
    `go_default_xtest` for external tests. Gazelle now generates
    the name  based on the last component of the path. For example, a test
    in `//foo/bar` is named `bar_test`, and uses internal and external

    """Recompiles some archives in order to split internal and external tests.

    go_test, like 'go test', splits tests into two separate archives: an
    internal archive ('package foo') and an external archive
    ('package foo_test'). The library under test is embedded into the internal
    archive. The external archive may import it and may depend on symbols
    defined in the internal test files.

    To avoid conflicts, the library under test must not be linked into the test
    binary, since the internal test archive embeds the same sources.
    Libraries imported by the external test that transitively import the
    library under test must be recompiled too, or the linker will complain that
    export data they were compiled with doesn't match the export data they
    are linked with.

    This function identifies which archives may need to be recompiled, then
    declares new output files and actions to recompile them. This is an
    unfortunately an expensive process requiring O(V+E) time and space in the
    size of the test's dependency graph for each test.

    Args:
        go: go object returned by go_context.
        external_go_info: GoInfo for the external archive.
        internal_archive: GoArchive for the internal archive.
        library_labels: labels for embedded libraries under test.

    Returns:
        external_source: recompiled GoInfo for the external archive. If no
            recompilation is needed, the original GoInfo is returned.
        internal_archive: recompiled GoArchive for the internal archive. If no
            recompilation is needed, the original GoInfo is returned.
