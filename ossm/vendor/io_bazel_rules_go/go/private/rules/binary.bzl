go_tool_binary depends on tools and libraries that are part of the Go SDK.
It does not depend on other toolchains. It can only compile binaries that
just have a main package and only depend on the standard library and don't
require build constraints.

It is currently only used to build the `builder` tool maintained as part of
rules_go as well as the `pack` tool provided by the Go SDK in source form
only as of Go 1.25. Combining both builds into a single action drastically
reduces the overall build time due to Go's own caching mechanism.
