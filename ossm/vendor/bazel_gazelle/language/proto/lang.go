// Package proto provides support for protocol buffer rules.
// It generates proto_library rules only (not go_proto_library or any other
// language-specific implementations).
//
// Configuration
//
// Configuration is largely controlled by Mode. In disable mode, proto rules are
// left alone (neither generated nor deleted). In legacy mode, filegroups are
// emitted containing protos. In default mode, proto_library rules are
// emitted. The proto mode may be set with the -proto command line flag or the
// "# gazelle:proto" directive.
//
// The configuration is largely public, and other languages may depend on it.
// For example, go uses Mode to determine whether to generate go_proto_library
// rules and ignore static .pb.go files.
//
// Rule generation
//
// Currently, Gazelle generates at most one proto_library per directory. Protos
// in the same package are grouped together into a proto_library. If there are
// sources for multiple packages, the package name that matches the directory
// name will be chosen; if there is no such package, an error will be printed.
// We expect to provide support for multiple proto_libraries in the future
// when Go has support for multiple packages and we have better rule matching.
// The generated proto_library will be named after the directory, not the
// proto or the package. For example, for foo/bar/baz.proto, a proto_library
// rule will be generated named //foo/bar:bar_proto.
//
// Dependency resolution
//
// proto_library rules are indexed by their srcs attribute. Gazelle attempts
// to resolve proto imports (e.g., import foo/bar/bar.proto) to the
// proto_library that contains the named source file
// (e.g., //foo/bar:bar_proto). If no indexed proto_library provides the source
// file, Gazelle will guess a label, following conventions.
//
// No attempt is made to resolve protos to rules in external repositories,
// since there's no indication that a proto import comes from an external
// repository. In the future, build files in external repos will be indexed,
// so we can support this (#12).
//
// Gazelle has special cases for Well Known Types (i.e., imports of the form
// google/protobuf/*.proto). These are resolved to rules in
// @com_google_protobuf.
