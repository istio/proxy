# As of today we do not support QUIC/HTTP3, hence we exclude it from the build, always.
# Unfortunately, just setting //bazel:http3=False, is not enough to achieve this.
# Instead, we also have to use boringssl=fips define and filter on the nofips tag.
# This is based on the fact that the FIPS version of BoringSSL doesn't provide enough
# of the functions required to build the QUIC implementation provided by Quiche i.e. if
# we say that we are using the FIPS version of BoringSSL, then all the QUIC support is
# excluded from the build.
