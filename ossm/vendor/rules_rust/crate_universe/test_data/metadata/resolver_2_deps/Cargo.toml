# Reqwest on non wasm platforms will enable the `tokio/net` feature
# through `hyper-util`. With `resolver = 1` this would result in `mio`
# being added as a dependency to `tokio` for wasm platforms even though
# `tokio` is never a dependency in this configuration and thus features
# enabled by `reqwest` should have no impact on `tokio`. `resolver = 2`
# correctly identifies this.
