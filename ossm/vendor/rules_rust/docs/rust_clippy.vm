## Overview
]]#

[Clippy][clippy] is a tool for catching common mistakes in Rust code and improving it. An
expansive list of lints and the justification can be found in their [documentation][docs].

#[[
### Setup
]]#

Simply add the following to the `.bazelrc` file in the root of your workspace:

```text
build --aspects=@rules_rust//rust:defs.bzl%rust_clippy_aspect
build --output_groups=+clippy_checks
```

This will enable clippy on all [Rust targets](./defs.md).

Note that targets tagged with `no-clippy` will not perform clippy checks

To use a local clippy.toml, add the following flag to your `.bazelrc`. Note that due to
the upstream implementation of clippy, this file must be named either `.clippy.toml` or
`clippy.toml`. Using a custom config file requires Rust 1.34.0 or newer.

```text
build --@rules_rust//rust/settings:clippy.toml=//:clippy.toml
```
